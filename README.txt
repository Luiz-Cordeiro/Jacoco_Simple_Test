Ok, if you need to learn a basic Jacoco test you're in the right code!

This code is a simple Jacoco test with Maven, developed under de Eclipe's IDE. 
Here we just have some conditions in a very (very, very) simple code.
The tests cover all the branches and instructions, you can see it in the AppTest.java file
Feel free to clone the code and use it to learn more.

My best regards,
